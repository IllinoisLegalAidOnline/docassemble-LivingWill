question: |
  Living will
subquestion: |
  A living will is a document that tells your doctor and your family what your wishes about end-of-life medical care are in case you get a **{terminal condition :question-circle:}**
  
  Your living will is only used if you can't tell your doctor that you do not want medical care which will only make you live longer but won't heal you. For example, you might be in a coma, and there is no medical care that will wake you up, or keep you from dying.

question: |
  Death delaying procedures
subquestion: |
  Some medical care can keep you alive but cannot improve your health. This type of care is known as death delaying procedures.

  Some examples of death delaying procedures are:
  
  * Assisted ventilation, 
  * Artificial kidney treatments,  
  * Intravenous feeding or medication, 
  * Blood transfusions,
  * Tube feeding,
  * Cardiac resuscitation, and
  * Amputation.
  
  Some medical care, such as painkillers, keeps you comfortable. Such medical care is not a death delaying procedure.

  **What if I want some death delaying procedures but not others?**

  Do you want to be given a feeding tube if you have a terminal condition?
subquestion: |
  Medical care providing food and water can be death delaying procedures. This can include tube feeding or IV drips for someone with a **{terminal condition :question-circle:}**

  However, withholding food or water may result in death only due to starvation or dehydration. A living will does not normally allow a doctor to withhold food and water in such a case.
  
  If you select **No**, you will need to initial the paragraph saying you do not want a feeding tube.
